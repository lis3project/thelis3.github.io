## Partnership

If you want to form a partnership with us, please contact Johnnie Yu or Daniel Wei. For student organizations, we will be able to provide a lot! Some basic services are listed below. These are the easy ones that we will be able to provide almost immediately! More detail, requests, and/or customised services can be discussed.

**For All Organizations:**
- A strong team of graphic designers to help with any designing, including poster design, templates, proposals, formatting, etc.
- A magazine released bi-annually, recapping and promoting events that happened in the past 6 months or will be happening recently.
- Promotion via Wechat account
	- List of all of our partners
    - Announce upcoming events
    - Produce weekly newsletters of things that happened around Shanghai
- Translation of English to Chinese or Chinese to English and proofreading as well (has to be event-related).

**For smaller/new start-up student organizations:**
- A simple website to detail your project, with a [name].lis3.com web address
- A [name]@lis3.com email address
- Help organize signups/submissions (we have a market research company helping us as well, www.findoout.cn)

**For larger/more mature student organizations:**
- Help promote your events offline, via our Council, to both local schools and international schools. The can allow events to gain more participants, through an already established connection with schools instead of trying to communicate with schools from scratch.
- Features in our Wechat platform posts
- Market research and survey - Our market research company supporting us will be able to, for free, design professional surveys for whatever purpose. 
- Any other custom requirements
